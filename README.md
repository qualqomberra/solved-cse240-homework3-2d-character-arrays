<h1>Programming Assignment</h1>




For this assignment, you can use ASU General GNU GCC environment or Visual Studio. Please specify the environment that you use at the beginning of your program:

// State the IDE that you use: Visual Studio or GCC

If you use any other environment, please test it either using GCC or visual Studio before submission. If you do not specify the environment, the grader will use either GCC or Visual Studio, but not both. If you program does not compile or execute correctly, your grade will be deducted.  <strong>GCC command to compile this program: <em>gcc -std=c99 -o output hw03q1.c </em></strong>Execute with:<em> ./output </em>







<ol>

 <li>You are given hw03q1.c file, which contains a partially completed program. You are to follow the instructions contained in comments and complete the required functions. You will be writing functions for a program that does manipulation on 1-D and 2-D arrays. In one part, the program defines several common operations on 2D integer arrays (AKA matrices). In another function, you are asked to reverse one long user-input string and then count the number of occurrences of a character in that string. Example output given below. Go through the C file and see the sample expected output below. [50 points]</li>
